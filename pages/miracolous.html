        <p class="p1-M2-season2">miracoloues season 2</p>
        <p class="p2-M2-season2">In this season we will know that Hawkemouth is Adrian's father and Natalie Gabriel's
            assistant
        </p>
        <p class="p3-M2-season2">Adrien is injured in the pile to become the white cat and the future character Panix,
            who owns
            the Maracles Rabbit, appears to go back in time.</p>
        <p class="p4-M2-season2">Chloe tries to gain her mother's attention and finds Miraculous the bee (which gives
            the power
            of crippling) and turns into the queen bee, but she will reveal her identity in front of everyone, then the
            ladybug tries to return the miraculous to Master Fu, so Chloe returns him to the ladybug. Then Master Fu
            Miraculous gives the tortoise (which gives the power of protection) to the ladybug to give it to Nino to
            help her with difficult tasks. Meanwhile, a girl named Kagami falls in love with Adrien, but he considers
            her only a friend, and a boy named Luca, who is the brother of Marinette's friend Julica, appears and
            admires Marinette.</p>
        <p class="p5-M2-season2">At the end of the second season, Hawke Moth (Gabriel) and Natalie will prepare a plan
            by
            infecting Laila with akuma again to become Vulpina, so she creates an illusion about the akuma-infected
            ladybug trying to kill the black cat. Ladybug</p>
        <p class="p6-M2-season2">The red Moth will appear in this at the end, and the ladybird and the cat noir will
            stand with
            the ladybird after all her team is hit by the pile, but the cat will stay by her side</p>
        <p class="p7-M2-season2">Of course, we will not forget the season, the episode of the evil bear, where Adrien
            danced
            with Marinette and he kissed her, but Chloe spoiled it, and we will not forget the episode of the ice cream
            seller, as Cat Noir was working on a date with Ladybug, but she did not come</p>

        <p class="p2-M3-season3">The third season, we will see from Miracles that Aden will know the identity of Ladybug
            and
            confess to her that he loves her, but Gabriel will know and will stop them, but Adrien will turn into a
            white cat and then she will enter Banyx and she will go back in time for me to fix everything</p>
        <p class="p3-M3-season3">And at the end of the season, the ladybug will fight the red Moth, and she will become
            the
            guardian of the Miracles after Master Foo</p>
        <p class="p4-M3-season3">After that, Fu will forget everything, but the red Moth will know the identity of other
            Miracles heroes such as Nino, Alia, Kagami, Kim and Chloe.</p>

        <p class="p1-M4-season4">miracoloues season 4</p>
        <p class="p2-M4-season4">In the fourth season, we will see many events, as Marinette will lose the Miraculous
            box, and
            we will see Cat Noir standing next to the ladybug, although she rejected him more than once, but he tries
            and will remain by her side and support her. Something you will take it immediately and take the ladybug's
            yoyo flix and bring all the miracles to Gabriel and from here the suffering began as the ladybug collapsed
        </p>
        <p class="p3-M4-season4">Marinette stands next to Adrien because his father wants to take him out of the country
            with
            Lily, but Adrien refuses because he doesn't want to become a model, but Gabriel's plan is to make him travel
            to get revenge on Ladybug and take all the Miracles from her, but Adrien and Felix will switch roles.</p>
        <p class="p4-M4-season4">As we know that Felix and Adrien look alike and Felix doesn't want to leave with
            Natalie but
            what happens is Adrian takes Flex's clothes and Flex takes Adrien's clothes and Flex travels with Natalie
            and Lily</p>

        <p class="p2-M5-season5">We will not talk much about this season because it did not show much of it, but the
            ladybug succeeded in recovering Miraculous the rabbit. King Monarch was about to go back in time and reveal
            the identity of the ladybug and the cat, but she managed to retrieve the Miracles from him. Jeremy Zag said
            that we only saw the good side of Miracles with us, that is the worst Coming, ladybug and cat noir must
            prepare well for me anything and retrieve all the miraculous by any way</p>
        <p class="p3-M5-season5">We also believe that Natalie will not help Gabriel in the last conversation with
            Natalie and Gabriel.</p>
